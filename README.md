## 🧠 Technical Highlights (What I Learned)

This project was a deep dive into practical client-side development:

* **DOM Manipulation Mastery:** Gained proficiency in selecting, creating, and modifying HTML elements to dynamically manage the cart state without page reloads.
* **Event Handling:** Effectively used JavaScript event listeners (`click`, etc.) to trigger functions for adding, removing, and quantity updates.
* **Utility-First Styling:** Solidified understanding of Tailwind CSS for building complex, responsive layouts with minimal custom CSS.
* **Code Organization:** Focused on writing clean, modular JavaScript code to handle separate responsibilities (e.g., cart logic vs. price calculation).
